🌦️ Weather Application 🌤️

This Weather Application 🌦️ is a simple yet effective web-based project designed to display real-time weather information 🌍 for any city in the world. Developed using HTML 🧱, CSS 🎨, and JavaScript ⚙️ in Visual Studio Code 💻, it offers a smooth and user-friendly interface for checking live weather conditions.

🔧 Technologies Used
HTML5 🧱 – is used to build the structure of the web page, including the header, input field, button, and result display area.

CSS3 🎨 – is applied to style the layout with padding, background colors, shadows, rounded corners, and font styles, giving the app a modern and minimalistic appearance.

JavaScript ⚙️ – handles dynamic operations like user input capture, API calls, data extraction, and updating the web page in real-time.

VS Code 💻 – serves as the development environment, providing features like live preview, syntax highlighting, and version control integration.

🖼️ User Interface
The application’s UI is centered in a beautiful card layout 📄 with a soft sky-blue background 🌈 to match the weather theme. At the top, it displays the title "Weather Application" in bold 🖊️. Below that, there's a search bar 🔍 where users can enter any city name (e.g., "Ranchi") and a "Get Weather" button 🔘 that triggers the weather search.

Once the user submits a valid city name, the application displays:

📍 City Name (e.g., "Ranchi")

☁️ Weather Icon – changes dynamically based on the condition (e.g., clouds, sun, rain)

📄 Weather Description (e.g., "overcast clouds")

🌡️ Temperature in Celsius (e.g., "25°C")

💨 Wind Speed (e.g., "2.23 m/s")

💧 Humidity level (e.g., "84%")

This clean layout ensures that all weather details are visually organized and easy to read.

🔁 Functionality
The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API 🌐 to fetch real-time weather data. When a user types a city name and clicks the button:

🔄 A request is sent to the weather API.

📥 The response includes weather condition, temperature, wind, and humidity.

🖥️ JavaScript dynamically updates the DOM with this data.

🧩 In case of an error (e.g., wrong city name), an appropriate message is shown (not visible in screenshot but assumed).

💡 Key Features
